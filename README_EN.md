# Interactive Data Structure Visualization Platform

English | [简体中文](./README.md)

An interactive data structure visualization platform built with Vue 3 and Vite, helping users intuitively understand and manipulate common data structures.

## Features

- **Multiple Data Structure Visualizations**: Supports basic data structures including arrays, stacks, queues, binary trees, and graphs
- **Interactive Operations**: Provides an intuitive user interface to add, delete, and modify elements in data structures
- **Animation Effects**: Smooth animations during operations enhance the learning experience
- **Detailed Explanations**: Each data structure comes with detailed descriptions and characteristic introductions
- **Example Data**: Provides sample data to quickly understand the representation of various data structures

## Supported Data Structures

### Array
- Random access to elements
- Add and remove elements
- View array indices and values

### Stack
- Push operation
- Pop operation
- View top element

### Queue
- Enqueue operation
- Dequeue operation
- View front element

### Binary Tree
- Insert nodes
- Visualize tree structure
- Dynamic layout adjustment

### Graph
- Add nodes and edges
- Drag to adjust node positions
- Support for directed graph representation

## Technology Stack

- **Vue 3**: Using the latest Composition API
- **Vite**: Fast frontend build tool
- **Font Awesome**: Rich icon library
- **SVG**: For drawing complex data structures (such as trees and graphs)
